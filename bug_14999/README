PostgreSQL 10.1: pg_rewind corrupts control file global/pg_control

bug
===

libpq_fetch.c loops twice over files in pgdata, a first time in 
libpq_executeFileMap(), and then a second time (for files with action
FILE_ACTION_COPY or FILE_ACTION_COPY_TAIL) in receiveFileChunks(). 
For FILE_ACTION_COPY, it deletes (truncates) the file from the target directory
already during the first loop. If pg_rewind then encounters a read-only file 
(e.g. server.key) still during the first loop, it exits with pg_fatal
("could not open target file"). After such truncation of global/pg_control
pg_rewind cannot run again ("unexpected control file size 0, , expected 8192")
and a restore from pg_basebackup is needed. 

patch
=====

Truncation of the file was moved to the second loop. Truncation occurs there if
chunks are written into files at offset 0. This is the case for 
FILE_ACTION_COPY. An additional SQL "ORDER BY path, begin" ensures that these
chunks are processed first.

$ docker run -d --name unpatched unpatched
$ docker logs -f unpatched # wait for "done", then CTRL+C
$ docker run -d --name patched patched
$ docker logs -f patched # wait for "done", then CTRL+C
